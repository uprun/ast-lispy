functions more than 30 lines are hard to read
scopes more than 10 lines hard to balance manually , I mean parentheses {}
better to have some preset that creates function from full name like "lisperanto.GetOperation_on_done"
and I need tabbulate functionality I mean Tab and Shift+Tab
oh yeah I need ability to edit all files
and I need history of edits, like save events from editor

I need commands "create a function"
I need snapshots so I can remove failed version
ough yes, I often use functionality to move expression into a function or a variable
